Welcome. <a class="header-anchor" href="#you-found-me-welcome" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;You found me! Welcome.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Hi. My name is Ian Mac Moore. This isn&#39;t my first attempt at having one of these things, but it&#39;s my first time making one &quot;from scratch&quot;. I use quotes because I&#39;m using a bunch of technology building blocks (can follow github link in upper right), so it&#39;s scratch in the Betty Crocker sense of adding some ingredients and baking. But that&#39;s just the state of things, I think.</p><p>So...What am I doing here? Well, I&#39;m on a growth journey, like all of us. And these skills of software development, and design, and data viz, etc. are relatively new to me--the pivot in this direction happened for me in 2020, which is when I created my business name and completed a coding bootcamp and began consulting. In the words of David Bowie (one of my favorite artists):</p><blockquote><p>I&#39;ve nothing much to offer</p><p>There&#39;s nothing much to take</p><p>I&#39;m an absolute beginner</p><p>And I&#39;m absolutely sane</p></blockquote><p>That&#39;s where I always want to be though, no matter how far along I get--the Zen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">beginner&#39;s mind</a>. &quot;See Newly&quot; is exactly this for me. Every person has something to offer, and I hope that I can help others in all ways to gain a new perspective by interacting with me.</p><p>I look forward to sharing more soon.</p>',9),l=[s];function r(h,d,c,m,p,u){return t(),o("div",null,l)}const _=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
