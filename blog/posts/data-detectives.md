# The Data Detectives, by Tim Harford
February 25, 2025; Portland, OR

## Hello, it's been a while
Since I last updated here, I have moved to Portland. There are a lot of challenges, but it feels like the right place to be. I'm starting classes again. It feels like the right thing to do despite the turbulence evident in society and the world at large. I can only do a little. 

## Book review, a little late to the game
I think I saw this title in library, and then just added it to Libby and forgot about it until it was available several weeks later. I recognized the author's name from a previous podcast I enjoyed, [Cautionary Tales](https://timharford.com/articles/cautionarytales/), which I apparently am sorely behind on. 

Tim is one of those special voices able to distill complex ideas into easily comprehisible swigs.
