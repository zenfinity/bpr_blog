## You found me! Welcome.
Hi. My name is Ian Mac Moore. This isn't my first attempt at having one of these things, but it's my first time making one "from scratch". I use quotes because I'm using a bunch of technology building blocks (can follow github link in upper right), so it's scratch in the Betty Crocker sense of adding some ingredients and baking. But that's just the state of things, I think.

So...What am I doing here? Well, I'm on a growth journey, like all of us. And these skills of software development, and design, and data viz, etc. are relatively new to me--the pivot in this direction happened for me in 2020, which is when I created my business name and completed a coding bootcamp and began consulting. In the words of David Bowie (one of my favorite artists):

>I've nothing much to offer
>
>There's nothing much to take
>
>I'm an absolute beginner
>
>And I'm absolutely sane


That's where I always want to be though, no matter how far along I get--the Zen [beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin). "See Newly" is exactly this for me. Every person has something to offer, and I hope that I can help others in all ways to gain a new perspective by interacting with me.

I look forward to sharing more soon.
