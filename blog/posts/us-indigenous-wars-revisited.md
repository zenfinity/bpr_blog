I've gotten advice recently to practice making quick visuals. Making this blog is a step towards this. I made a viz a year ago exploring war waged against indigenous peoples, and there was more I wanted to do, so I figured I revisit and try to make something quick. 

I like playing with new tools, and I just learned about [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), which was purchased by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/flourish/) a couple years ago now.  

Besides the topic being difficult in and of itself, the data is multi-faceted--groups of people, geographically diverse, and on-going conflicts spread over hundreds of years. This isn't meant to be comprehensive, but just give a sense of the scope.
