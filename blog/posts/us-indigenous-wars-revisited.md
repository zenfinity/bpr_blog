I've gotten advice recently to practice making quick visuals. Making this blog is a step towards this. I [made a viz](https://zenfinity.github.io/USIndigenousWars/) a year ago exploring war waged against indigenous peoples, and there was more I wanted to do, so I figured I'd revisit and try to make something quick. 

Thanks to [Jeremy](https://medium.com/@jeremy3/create-a-blog-with-vitepress-c4b1c203d688) for inspiration on helping get going on new posts.

I like playing with new tools, and I just learned about [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/), which was purchased by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/flourish/) a couple years ago now.  

Besides the topic being difficult in and of itself, the data is multi-faceted--groups of people, geographically diverse, and on-going conflicts spread over hundreds of years. This isn't meant to be comprehensive, but just give a sense of the scope.
